# About

## Liminality

Liminality is a collective of developers and designers exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, spatial computing, and design.

### Our Mission

We exist in the liminal space—the threshold between what is and what could be. Our work explores emerging technologies and their potential to transform how we create, interact, and think.

### What We Write About

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Deep dives into AI/ML techniques, applications, and ethical considerations
- **Spatial Computing**: Exploring AR, VR, and the future of human-computer interaction
- **Design**: The intersection of technology and design thinking
- **Innovation**: Pushing boundaries and exploring new paradigms

### The Collective

We are a group of curious minds—developers, designers, researchers, and thinkers—who believe that the most interesting work happens at the boundaries between disciplines.
