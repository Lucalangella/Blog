This is a small lab for spatial ideas – fast prototypes, half‑finished thoughts, and things that only make sense once you put a headset on.

Instead of shipping polished case studies, I want a place to document the messy middle:  
what I tried, what broke, and what surprised me.

### Constraints of the lab

These experiments follow a few simple rules:

- Small scope: each idea should be buildable in days, not months.  
- Real hardware: tested on actual devices, not just Figma frames.  
- Honest notes: what worked, what didn’t, and why I’d change it.

### Areas I want to explore

Some themes that keep coming back:

- Depth as a design material, not just a visual effect.  
- Perception of distance, scale, and focus when you move your head instead of a cursor.  
- Calm, ambient interfaces that sit at the edge of attention instead of in the center.

Over time, this page will turn into a map of the experiments – a thread through different prototypes, patterns, and dead ends worth remembering.
