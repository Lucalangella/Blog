Liminality is the space between two states – not quite where we were, not yet where we are going.  
It is the hallway, the loading screen, the moment before something clicks into place.

In spatial computing, these in‑between moments are everywhere:  
the transition from 2D to 3D, from handheld to head‑worn, from “app” to ambient context.

### Why the in‑between matters

Most products obsess over endpoints: the screen, the button, the final frame.  
But the most interesting questions live in motion – how we arrive somewhere, how it feels to move through a space.

Liminal experiences are where:

- Expectations are soft, so people are more open to new patterns.  
- Time stretches, giving room for subtle animation, sound, and haptics.  
- Identity and presence feel fluid – you can be both here and there.

### Designing for thresholds

Instead of treating transitions as implementation details, we can design them as first‑class surfaces:

- Entrances: how someone “enters” a world, scene, or mode.  
- Hand‑offs: how attention flows between devices and contexts.  
- Exits: how an experience ends without feeling abrupt or jarring.

The question I keep asking myself is:  
what does a product look like when the threshold becomes the core of the experience?

This article is a sketchbook for that question – collecting examples, fragments, and experiments that live between worlds.
