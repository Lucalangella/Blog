Design systems usually start from components: buttons, cards, grids, icons.  
In spatial contexts and liminal experiences, the primitives feel different.

Here, the building blocks are timelines, transitions, and relationships in space.  
What matters is not just how something looks, but how it appears, moves, and disappears.

### Beyond static components

Some questions I want this series to answer:

- What does a “component” mean when it can exist at different depths and scales?  
- How do we define spacing, rhythm, and hierarchy in 3D?  
- How do we keep motion consistent across many teams and surfaces?

### Patterns for in‑between states

Liminal design systems should help with:

- Entrance patterns: how surfaces fade in, slide in, or grow into place.  
- Focus patterns: how attention shifts between objects and layers.  
- Exit patterns: how things leave without feeling abrupt or losing context.

This article will slowly evolve into a set of reusable patterns – a starting point for anyone designing systems that live between physical and digital spaces.
